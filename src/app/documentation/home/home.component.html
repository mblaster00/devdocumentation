		<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
		The purpose of this site is to detail the design principles, objects, behaviours and error handling for the
		Logidoo Ecommerce API. The overriding goal of the API is to enable all parties to implement Logidoo
		Ecommerce.

		<section class="principles">
			<h3><strong>Principles</strong></h3>
			<p>APIs in a flexible, yet consistent manner. We hope to achieve this by the implementing the following
				principles:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use of REST architectural principles.</li>
				<!-- <li>Creation of a standard set of transaction types and other key enumerations, removing the need for
					developers to map for each and every API implementation.</li> -->
				<li>Use of ISO international standards for enumerators such as currency and country codes</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section class="overview">
			<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
			<ol>
				<li> You need a valid API key to send requests the API endpoints. You can get key from the <a
						href="https://logidoo.ecommerce.dev"><strong>integrations dashboard.</strong></a></li>
				<li> The API has an access <a href="https://logidoo.ecommerce.dev"> rate limit</a> applied to it.</li>
				<li> The <b>Ecommerce API</b> will only response to secured communication done over HTTPs. HTTP requests
					will be sent a 301 redirect to corresponding HTTPs ressources.</li>
				<li> Response to every request is sent in <a href="https://json.org/example.html"> JSON format </a>. In
					case the API request results in an error, it is represented by an <b> "Error": {{ '{' }} }</b></li>
				<li> The request method (verb) determines the nature of action you intend to perform. A request made
					using
					the <b>GET</b> method implies that you want to fetch something from Logidoo, and <b>POST</b> implies
					you
					want to save something new to Logidoo.</li>
				<li> The API call will respond with appropriate <a href="https://httpstatuses.com/">HTTP status code</a>
					for all requests. Within Ecommerce API when a response is received, the status code is highlighted
					and
					accompanied by a help text that indicates the possible meaning of the response code. A <b> 200 Ok
					</b> indicates that all went well, while <b>4XX</b> or <b>5XX</b> response codes indicate an error
					from
					the requesting client or our API servers respectively. </li>
			</ol>
		</section>

		<section class="authentication">
			<h3><strong>Authentication</strong></h3>
			<ul>
				<li>An API Key is required to be sent as part of every request to the Ecommerce API, in the form of an
					<b>secret-token</b> request header.
				</li>

				<li>If you do not have an API Key, you can easily generate one by heading over to the Ecommerce
					Integrations
					Dashboard.</li>

				<li>An API Key tells our API server that the request it received came from you. Everything that you have
					access
					to in Ecommerce is accessible with an API Key that is generated by you.</li>

				<li>For ease of use inside Ecommerce, you could store your API key in an environment variable called
					SECRET_KEY
					and this Collection will automatically use it to make API calls.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3><strong>Manage Your Subscriptions</strong></h3>
			<p>Developers are issued a <code>Secret Key</code> for every product .</p>
			<p>Secret Subscription key provides access to the API. Without it a developer
				cannot access any of the APIs. Subscriptions are stored under the user profile and have no expiry.</p>
			<!-- <p>Both primary and secondary Subscription key provides access to the API. Without one of them a developer
				cannot access any of the APIs. Subscriptions are stored under the user profile and have no expiry.</p> -->
			<!-- <p>Here you can view the status of the package, date it started, conduct cancellation or activation actions,
				and also show or regenerate your <code>Primary Key</code> and <code>Secondary Key</code></p>
